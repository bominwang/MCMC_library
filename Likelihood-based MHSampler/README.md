# Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for sampling from a target distribution. The algorithm is designed to support both CPU and GPU execution.

## Features

- Supports both block-wise and component-wise transfer methods.
- Provides options for different proposal distributions (uniform and normal).
- Allows for easy integration of custom target distributions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- CuPy (for GPU acceleration)
- SciPy

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:
